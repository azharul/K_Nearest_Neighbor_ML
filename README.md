# K_Nearest_Neighbor_ML

This an implementation of K nearest neighbors algorithm in python. It uses the iris data set to make predictions.
The iris data set is divided into training and testing sets. The user defined K nearest neighbor algorithm is trained using the training data set. Then it makes predictions on the testing data set. Finally, the accuracy of the data set is measured. 
Scikit-learn and random package is used in the program.

Note# for now, the code is 1-nearest neighbor. In the future I am planning it to make KNN.
